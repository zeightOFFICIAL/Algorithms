/*
The KMP matching algorithm uses degenerating property 
(pattern having same sub-patterns appearing more than 
once in the pattern) of the pattern and improves the 
worst case complexity to O(n). The basic idea behind 
KMPâ€™s algorithm is: whenever we detect a mismatch 
(after some matches), we already know some of the 
characters in the text of the next window. We take 
advantage of this information to avoid matching 
the characters that we know will anyway match.
