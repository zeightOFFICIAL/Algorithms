# Algorithms

The word Algorithm means: "a set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations" or "a procedure for solving a mathematical problem in a finite number of steps".
In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a finite sequence of rigorous instructions, typically used to solve a class of specific problems or to perform a computation. Algorithms are used as specifications for performing calculations and data processing. By making use of artificial intelligence, algorithms can perform automated deductions (referred to as automated reasoning) and use mathematical and logical tests to divert the code execution through various routes (referred to as automated decision-making). Using human characteristics as descriptors of machines in metaphorical ways was already practiced by Alan Turing with terms such as "memory", "search" and "stimulus".

## Sorting

In computer science, a sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements of a list into an order. The most frequently used orders are numerical order and lexicographical order, and either ascending or descending. Efficient sorting is important for optimizing the efficiency of other algorithms (such as search and merge algorithms) that require input data to be in sorted lists. Sorting is also often useful for canonicalizing data and for producing human-readable output.
Currently available algorithms:
* <b><em>Bubble sort</em></b>
* <b><em>Comb sort</em></b>

* <b><em>Cocktail sort</em></b> is an advanced two-directional bubble sort. The man idea behind cocktail sort is about moving the min and max value to the sides. Firstly, we move the biggest to the right end of the array, then we go backwards and move the smallest to the left side. Gradually the array becomes sorted, as we move element by element to the proper side, as if we were shaking with array from left to right and so on. Comparison of neighbors (exchanging). Stable: yes. Best case: O(n). Worst case: O(n^2).

## Substring search

In computer science, string-searching algorithms, sometimes called string-matching algorithms, are an important class of string algorithms that try to find a place where one or several strings (also called patterns) are found within a larger string or text. A basic example of string searching is when the pattern and the searched text are arrays of elements of an alphabet.
Currently available algorithms:
* <b><em>Boyer-Moore</em></b> 
* <b><em>Knuth–Morris–Pratt</em></b> 
* <b><em>Rabin-Karp</em></b> 
* <b><em>Naïve algorithm</em></b>
* <b><em>Bitap (Shift-OR)</em></b>

## Theory of numbers

In mathematics, the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two or more integers, which are not all zero, is the largest positive integer that divides each of the integers. For two integers x, y, the greatest common divisor of x and y is denoted gcd(x, y). For example, the GCD of 8 and 12 is 4.

* <b><em>Stein's algorithm</em></b>

A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers. A natural number greater than 1 that is not prime is called a composite number.

* <b><em>Sundaram sieve</em></b>

## Elementary functions

Exponentiation is a mathematical operation, written as b^n, involving two numbers, the base b and the exponent or power n. It is pronounced as "b raised to the power of n". When n is a positive integer, exponentiation corresponds to repeated multiplication of the base: that is, b^n is the product of multiplying bases n-times.

* <b><em>Exponentiation Squaring</em></b>
* <b><em>Naive exponentiation.</em></b>
