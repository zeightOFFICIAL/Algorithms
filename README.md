# String-searching algorithms
Comparison of string-searching algorithms

* Version 1.2

In computer science, string-searching algorithms, sometimes called string-matching algorithms, are an important class of string algorithms that try to find a place where one or several strings (also called patterns) are found within a larger string or text. A basic example of string searching is when the pattern and the searched text are arrays of elements of an alphabet.

Currently available algorithms:

* <b><em>Boyer-Moore</em></b> is an efficient string-searching algorithm that is the standard benchmark for practical string-search literature. It was developed by Robert S. Boyer and J Strother Moore in 1977.
* <b><em>Rabin-Karp</em></b> is a string-searching algorithm created by Richard M. Karp and Michael O. Rabin (1987) that uses hashing to find an exact match of a pattern string in a text. It uses a rolling hash to quickly filter out positions of the text that cannot match the pattern, and then checks for a match at the remaining positions.
* <b><em>Na√Øve algorithm</em></b> is a simple string-searching algorithm. It checks for all character of the main string to the pattern. Naive algorithm is exact string matching.
* <b><em>Bitap (Shift-OR)</em></b>, distinguishes itself from other well-known string searching algorithms in its natural mapping onto simple bitwise operations.

| Algorithm | Type | Matching time |
| :---:                 | :---:               | :---:  |
| Naive                 | Simple indexing, checks pattern and text one symbol at a time     | $$O(nm)$$ in best: $$O(2m)$$  |
| Boyer-Moore (1977)    | Bad char heuristics, advanced naive algorithm| $$O(mn)$$ in best: $$O(m/n)$$  |
| Rabin-Karp (1987)     | Hashing, compare hash of pattern with hash of text             | $$O(mn)$$  |
| Bitap (1964) Shift-OR | Uses features of circular bit shift and linearizability of bitwise OR and SHIFT | $$O(m*(n/32))$$ |

## Test results
The power of alphabet is 64 symbols (upper, lower-case latin, numbers). Length is adjustible. Searched pattern is 'ab'.
